# ddev-breeze-inertia-vue-starter

Simple starter to play around with [InertiaJS](https://inertiajs.com/) and [Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/starter-kits#breeze-and-inertia) with help of the open source dev tool [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for PHP. It runs in your browser (via [Gitpod DDEV launcher](https://drud.github.io/ddev-gitpod-launcher/)) or on your local machine via DDEV-local.

This repository was simply created by following the [DDEV Laravel Composer Quickstart](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/cli-usage/#laravel-composer-setup-example) and adapting the [Laravel Breeze Inertia Vue install docs](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/starter-kits#breeze-and-inertia) for DDEV usage. The Gitpod integration was made possible via [Gitpod DDEV launcher](https://drud.github.io/ddev-gitpod-launcher/) by [rfay](https://github.com/rfay). 

## 1. Play around ...

### ... in your browser via Gitpod:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#DDEV_REPO=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmandrasch%2Fddev-breeze-inertia-vue-starter,DDEV_ARTIFACTS=/https://github.com/drud/ddev-gitpod-launcher/)

After launching in gitpod, run these steps to create the initial config:

```bash
cd ddev-breeze-inertia-vue-starter/
ddev start && ddev composer install
ddev exec "cat .env.example | sed  -E 's/DB_(HOST|DATABASE|USERNAME|PASSWORD)=(.*)/DB_\1=db/g' > .env"
ddev artisan key:generate && ddev artisan migrate
ddev exec npm install && ddev exec npm run dev
```

Nice, your project should now be ready! ðŸ¥³

- Run `ddev exec npm run watch` to watch automatically for changes
- Start exploring by modifying the file `ddev-breeze-inertia-vue-starter/resources/js/Pages/Welcome.vue`.

### Troubleshooting

**You don't see the Simple Browser?**

Your project runs on port 8080, your project runs on port 8080. To view it in the browser just append `8080-` to the gitpod container url, e.g. `https://8080-drud-ddevgitpodlaunc-7zkg2ik76nm.ws-eu38.gitpod.io/`) You can click on the "Ports" menu in the gitpod taskbar as well to figure out the url and open the site in gitpods Simple Browser (or in another browser tab):

### ... on your local workspace:

- Pull this repository
- Install DDEV if you haven't, e.g. `brew install drud/ddev/ddev`, see [docs](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#installation)
- Run these initial steps (only needed for first time):

```bash
ddev start
ddev composer install
ddev exec "cat .env.example | sed  -E 's/DB_(HOST|DATABASE|USERNAME|PASSWORD)=(.*)/DB_\1=db/g' > .env"
ddev artisan key:generate
ddev artisan migrate
ddev exec npm install
ddev exec npm run dev
```

Run `ddev launch` to open your new site. 

You can run `ddev exec npm run watch` to watch automatically for changes. Start exploring by modifying the file `ddev-breeze-inertia-vue-starter/resources/js/Pages/Welcome.vue` for example.

## 2. How was this created?

This repository was simply created by following the [DDEV Laravel Composer Quickstart](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/cli-usage/#laravel-composer-setup-example) and adapting the [Laravel Breeze Inertia Vue](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/starter-kits#breeze-and-inertia) install commands for DDEV usage. The gitpod integration was made possible via [Gitpod DDEV launcher](https://drud.github.io/ddev-gitpod-launcher/) by [rfay](https://github.com/rfay). 

**DDEV Laravel Composer Quickstart**

```
mkdir my-laravel-app
cd my-laravel-app
ddev config --project-type=laravel --docroot=public --create-docroot
ddev start
ddev composer create --prefer-dist laravel/laravel
ddev exec "cat .env.example | sed  -E 's/DB_(HOST|DATABASE|USERNAME|PASSWORD)=(.*)/DB_\1=db/g' > .env"
ddev exec "php artisan key:generate"
```

See: https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/cli-usage/#laravel-composer-setup-example

**Breeze & Inertia (& vue ssr), modified for DDEV:**

```
ddev composer require laravel/breeze --dev
ddev artisan breeze:install vue --ssr
ddev npm install
ddev npm run dev
ddev artisan migrate
ddev launch
```

## TODOs

- [ ] Figure out if we can use [browsersync](https://laravel-mix.com/docs/6.0/browsersync) in Gitpod to reload the browser automagically.
